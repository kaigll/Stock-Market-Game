# Stock Market Simulator Game
This project is a small game, using a 16x2 LCD display and an STM32 Nucleo board.

In the game you begin with a balance of money and the goal is to grow this by buying and selling shares of companies to add to your portfolio. The companies have randomised news events which will lead stocks rising/falling in value, these will scroll past on the LCD.
