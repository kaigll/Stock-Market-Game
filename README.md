# Stock Market Simulator Game
This project is a small game, using a 16x2 LCD display and an STM32 Nucleo board.

In the game you begin with a balance of money and the goal is to grow your portfolio by buying and selling shares of companies. The companies have randomised news events which will lead stocks rising/falling in value, these will scroll past on the LCD.

This project was during my first year at University to develop my C++ skills and to learn how to interface with different types of components using a microcontroller.
